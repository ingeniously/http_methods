Because The Future is Cloud:wink:!.

## Getting Started

This project is the 2nd Part(Deployment) of [Diabetes Prediction Artificial Neural Network](https://github.com/ingeniously/diabetes_prediction_ann)



Some Few resources I used :dart: :

- [Azure Machine Learning](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab):**To Build and Deploy The neural Net Throught an End point**
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook):**To build the Web interface Back End Front End**
- [REST/API and Postman](Hostinghttps://www.postman.com/):**For  The HTTPS Request**
- [Firebase Hosting and Github Actions](https://firebase.google.com/):**For Automatic Deplpyement Flutter Web**
- [JavaScript Object Notation](https://www.hostinger.fr/tutoriels/quest-ce-que-json):**Format Used to Transfert Data and Parse it**
